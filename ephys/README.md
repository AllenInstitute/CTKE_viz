## Electrophysiology plots

Authors: Nathan Gouwens, Ray Sanchez

This folder contains a series of Python scripts written by Nathan Gouwens to randomly select cells from the Tolias lab Patch-seq dataset and plot action potential traces. These are
all included in the "make_traces_NG" subfolder. There is also one R script, "make_ephys_violins.R", which contains a function to plot all electrophysiology summary characteristics
for all cell type cards given a standard taxonomy file (as described for other panels), and the metadata files provided by the Tolias lab (also included in this folder).
