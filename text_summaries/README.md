## Generate text summaries

Author: Ray Sanchez

These scripts pull from sources highlighted in other subfolders - MERFISH, RNA-seq, Patch-Seq - and put some basic summary statistics into human-readable text. These
scripts are not "functionized" and need to be tailored to the taxonomy. In addtion, some manual editing was performed between auto-generation and placement into the cards.
